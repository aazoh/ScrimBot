Very simple discord bot used to book scrims, could be used for any game etc...

Once a message is sent in a specific channel the bot will react to the message with "âœ…" once someone clicks on the reaction it will send a message to the sender of the original message with the information of the person that reacted to it so you are able to DM them about organising / setting up the scrim etc.
